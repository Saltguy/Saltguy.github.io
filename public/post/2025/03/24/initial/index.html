    <p>This is my first entry to this &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. Typing that word makes me feel at least ten years older than I am, so can we get rid of the initial <em>b</em> and just call it a <em>log</em>? Its unclipped form is <em>weblog</em>, and since this kind of leisurely writing is now probably mainly on the web anyway, the <em>b</em> expresses no important distinction.</p>
<p>Though really, I feel a little embarassed writing a &ldquo;blog post&rdquo; in 2025, and so I want to justify the act with a change of wording.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really posted to any kind social media. I&rsquo;ve thought of it as vanity for a long time, but maybe dismissing it as such was an excuse, and in reality I&rsquo;ve all my life been scared to expose myself to strangers&rsquo; or acquaintances&rsquo; unspoken derision. I increasingly feel that my abstention has made me too inward-facing and damaged my abilities of self-expression.</p>
<p>Self-expression, I&rsquo;ve come to think, need not be &ldquo;deep&rdquo;, well thought out, or even interesting. If we try to really think things through, it&rsquo;ll take far too long, and then we&rsquo;ll start to go in circles. Truth, it seems, is a carefully formulated thesis, followed by a long list of caveats, and an even longer list of sources or data. I&rsquo;m not patient enough for that.</p>
<p>In short, I find myself wanting to write about things I do and things that interest me, with a lax approach to fact and fiction, and without too much effort towards writing entertainingly or digestibly.</p>
<p>If anyone happens upon this website without being told about it by me I&rsquo;m honored and probably a little embarrassed.</p>
