This is my first entry to this "blog". Typing that word makes me feel at least ten years older than I am, so can we get rid of the initial *b* and just call it a *log*? Its unclipped form is *weblog*, and since this kind of leisurely writing is now probably mainly on the web anyway, the *b* expresses no important distinction. 

Though really, I feel a little embarassed writing a "blog post" in 2025, and so I want to justify the act with a change of wording. 

I've never really posted to any kind social media. I've thought of it as vanity for a long time, but maybe dismissing it as such was an excuse, and in reality I've all my life been scared to expose myself to strangers' or acquaintances' unspoken derision. I increasingly feel that my abstention has made me too inward-facing and damaged my abilities of self-expression.

Self-expression, I've come to think, need not be "deep", well thought out, or even interesting. If we try to really think things through, it'll take far too long, and then we'll start to go in circles. Truth, it seems, is a carefully formulated thesis, followed by a long list of caveats, and an even longer list of sources or data. I'm not patient enough for that.

In short, I find myself wanting to write about things I do and things that interest me, with a lax approach to fact and fiction, and without too much effort towards writing entertainingly or digestibly. 

If anyone happens upon this website without being told about it by me I'm honored and probably a little embarrassed.
