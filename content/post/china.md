I arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of March, and today on the 21st I begin writing my first entry on the sleeper train from Chengdu to Guangzhou. I'd be lying if I said I've had *no* time to write, but I have kept myself, and been kept, quite busy. 

My past self has true-to-character deemed fit to burden me with three final assignments with deadlines towards the end of the trip. Luckily, "working" while travelling makes me feel cool and professional, so my efficiency has been quite good. The assignments belong to what us STEM-infected call "lallkurser", so the workload is quite manageable. The assignments seem to demand little more of me than to paraphrase the course material. Not difficult or punishing but necessary and tiring.
